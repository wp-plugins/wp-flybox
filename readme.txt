Since this uses CSS, some themes will affect the layout of the tabs. If yours is displaying incorrectly PLEASE let me know which theme is causing poblems and I will fix it as soon as I can.

If you want a tab that's not included then let me know and I'll add it!

= Is Javascript used? =

No and Yes, Not to display the tabs, but yes to displaying the social boxes. Javascript is also used to slide the tabs in Internet Explorer.

= Why won't this work with some themes? =

All themes have different CSS and layouts. Since no javascript is used, the CSS that is used may be affected by the theme. If this is the case PLEASE let me know so I can fix it.
